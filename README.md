# SpendWise
This is a website that enables a user to:
Track and categorize expenses
Provides summarized expense data
Allow for budget revisions (like adding to it or setting a new one)

(I would recommend running this on VS Code)

To access server, go to Git Bash and do the following:
python manage.py runserver

When making changes, also make sure to go on bash and do:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

I will post this on Netlify soon!
